% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\descript{TVConal Sports Analytics, Singapore}

\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space 
\vspace{6pt}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Developed a real-time player leg fault detection solution for cricket's DRS (decision review system). Attained 92\% AUC score. \vspace{3pt}

\item Optimized the ball tracking inference speed to 450 fps in cricket and table tennis projects by TensorRT conversion. \vspace{3pt}

\item Fine-tuned several action recognition models for various tasks like table tennis shot type recognition, and delivery slicing in cricket. 95\% accuracy/recall. \vspace{3pt}

\item Built an end-to-end solution for coach dashboard KPIs measurement which uses deep learning models to extract interesting details from sports event broadcast videos and translate them to coach needs.
% \item Developed a cloud-based solution to automate and enhance the engineering process for network installation using AWS and Python.
% \item Worked with other teams to create a system to collect and visualize telemetry data of network elements in real-time using AWS, Python, and DOMO.
% \item Consulted with other teams to jump-start cloud-technology adoption and solutions throughout the company.
% \item Contributed to initial planning for an optics-alignment system utilizing AWS, reinforcement learning, and an IoT architecture.
